# 404 Museum
A gallery of handcrafted 404 pages. Each “exhibit” is pure HTML + CSS (no JS, no frameworks). Use any exhibit as your site’s `/404.html`.

## Live
This repo is built for GitHub Pages. Enable it in **Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch (main)**.

## Structure
- `/` = museum lobby (index)
- `/exhibits/<name>/` = each 404 design (standalone)
- `/404.html` = the 404 used by this repo’s Pages site (pick any exhibit)

## Use an exhibit in your site
Copy the folder from `exhibits/<name>` into your project and rename `index.html` to `404.html`. Keep `styles.css` alongside it.

## Add a new exhibit
1. Duplicate a folder in `exhibits/`, rename it.
2. Change the heading/style.
3. Add the new card link to `/index.html`.
